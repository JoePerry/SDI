<p>In the last assignement I had a very hard time working my story into code.  I had a harder time expressing the story because of my limited code knowledge.  I examined the code that was presented to me for this project, and decided that it is best to make a story that featured different types of code as different characters.  </p>
<p>It didn't take long for me to come up with my brilliant plan.  In a master stroke of genious I decided to use code in reference to my favorite Star Trek: the Next Generation cast members.</p>
<p>Space... the final frontier...</p>
